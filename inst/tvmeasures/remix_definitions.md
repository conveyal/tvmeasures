#### Definitions

*Efficiency* Jobs and population within a half-mile of station areas divided by
weekday service miles. A higher number indicates more efficient service. Riders
per service mile is a common measure of organizational sustainability for
transit operators in that it balances a measure of the capital and operating
costs of a project against the project’s effectiveness in delivering service.
Within the RTV this measure is estimated from a project’s job and household
totals within a 1⁄2 mile catchment area divided by service miles as determined
by Remix.

*Compatibility* Ratio of jobs and population near the service area. A number
closer to 1 indicates a balance in land use and likely reduction in transfers.
This criterion considers the balance between jobs and population. The
job/population balance is defined as the smaller number of people or jobs
within a 1⁄2 mile catchment divided by the larger number. This provides an
elementary assessment of the land use mix along the corridor with more diverse
corridors measuring closer to 1. The number of jobs and people in the catchment
areas are taken from Remix.

*Social Equity* Population within 1⁄2 mile who are non-white, or are under the
poverty line (whichever is greater). We take from Remix the greater of either 1)
the percent of people with an income under the poverty line within a 1⁄2 mile of
project stations or 2) the percent of the non-white population within a 1⁄2 mile
of project stations. A larger number implies more support for disadvantaged
communities.
