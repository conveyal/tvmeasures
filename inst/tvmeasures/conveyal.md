To run the project evaluation for multiple projects,

  1. Point the file selectors on the left to the appropriate base scenario and weighted population tiff files.
  2. Point the file selector below to a set of regional analysis ouput `.tiff` files from Conveyal Analyst. You may select multiple files in Chrome and other modern web browsers.

The application will print a table (this may take a few minutes if you have many
projects) showing the project evaluation measures based on Conveyal outputs.
