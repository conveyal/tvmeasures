Conveyal Analysis provides a number of ways to measure employment accessibility,
depending on the level of service, target populations, and type of jobs. We use
each of the following measures to get more wide ranging view of a projectâ€™s
expected impact on job access:

  - *POP Access*: Increase in the number of jobs within 45 minutes by transit from all points in the region. Each point is weighted by the total population in the region.
  - *POP 70*: Jobs accessible via transit by the 70th percentile grid cell, weighted by total population. An indicator of expanding transit to areas with little to know service.
  - *POP 90*: Jobs accessible via transit by the 90th percentile grid cell, weighted by total population. An indicator of expanding the number of areas with excellent service.
  - *EQ Access*: Increase in the number of jobs within 45 minutes by transit from all points in the region. Each point is weighted by low-income and non-white population.
  - *EQ 70*: Jobs accessible via transit by the 70th percentile grid cell, weighted by low-income and non-white population. An indicator of expanding transit to areas with little to know service.
  - *EQ 90*: Jobs accessible via transit by the 90th percentile grid cell, weighted by low-income and non-white population. An indicator of expanding the number of areas with excellent service.
